  <h1>Ideas as a Tree of Tokens</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>“Selling ideas:” each idea is a token, and each share has the property of allowing you to participate in governance for that token (minting new shares, where to allocate them, performing sales of those shares)</li>
    <li>Owning the token allows you to allocate either the DAO coin itself, ETH, or your own token to children of the token. Each owner of the token can decide the rate to fund derivative ideas of it</li>
    <li>Person that mints the token will always be the person that came up with the idea. No one else knew the idea existed until someone came up with it, and they have a profit incentive to be the first one to mint the token of their idea. <em>No need for bots (but you could allow users to make bots for their ideas for the purpose of improving UX)</em></li>
    <li>Token’s represent nodes in a tree of value, where the <em>value is determined by the market value of shares in that token</em>, which provides the above utility</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Allowing market to decide value means: <em>maximum accuracy</em> (value of the token is how much people are willing to pay); <em>no need for spam detection</em> (people won’t buy spam tokens); <em>people attribute data to themselves</em> (I’ll try to make my data into an token ASAP, even if the data isn’t public yet)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The DAO is represented by the root token in the tree</li>
    <li>New ideas formed by the DAO are children of that root token</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Owners of an token can decide where to allocate funds from their own token to derivative ideas</li>
      <li>Children receive those funds, and can do whatever they want with them</li>
      <li>Children can fund their own child ideas with their own token, with the token that their parent gave them, or with ETH</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Value is represented by the market value of token shares (e.g., on open sea)</li>
    <li><em>Scales with our scope:</em> as more and more ideas are added in the chain, previous ideas that delegate funds become more and more valuable on the market, but the owner of those tokens doesn’t necessarily have to do anything (i.e., cash out on the market)</li>
    <li><em>Value of an idea’s token shares:</em> why buy?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>As an idea becomes more and more influential, it begins to affect more and more people. Those people will want a say in how that idea is implemented, how it is developed, or even if it should be dismantled. To participate in that decision-making process, they will have to own shares of that idea’s token. This is the value of the token.</li>
